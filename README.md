BOX COLOR CHANGE

The aim of the project is to be able to toggle back and forth between at least two color on click.
First, I set the box color state and initialize it to blue, and set up a count. The I set up and bind the toggleColor method and link it to the onClick method.

PseudoCode:
If state count is even, set state color to blue and increment state count, else set state color to orange and increment state count.
